ESPER is an AI-powered prototype for multimodal claims assessment and fraud intelligence. It addresses two pain points in Car insurance: subjective visual grading and image-based fraud. The system analyzes vehicle photos and claim text to: (1) detect damaged parts with YOLOv8, (2) grade severity and map to cost bands using weighted averages calibrated on Importance of different part of the damage, and (3) expose tampering/reuse via ELA, copy-move, and metadata checks. Narrative–image consistency is measured with CLIP embeddings: we compute image–text cosine similarity and part/damage phrase alignment; low scores trigger review. Training/evaluation uses public datasets (Car Damage Severity.). For text–image alignment, aggregating into an interpretable risk score for triage. ESPER yields faster, consistent, and auditable decisions without access to private insurer data.
