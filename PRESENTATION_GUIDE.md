## üìù Speaking Notes

### **Opening (2 minutes)**
```
"Insurance claim processing is broken. 
3-5 days wait, inconsistent decisions, 15% fraud rate.

We built ESPER - an AI system that processes claims in 3 seconds 
with full transparency."
```

### **Problem Statement (3 minutes)**
```
"Let me show you a typical scenario...
[Walk through manual process timeline]

This costs insurers $250 per claim and frustrates customers."
```

### **Our Solution (2 minutes)**
```
"ESPER automates this entire process using AI.
But unlike other AI systems, ours is fully explainable."
```

### **Architecture (3 minutes)**
```
"Here's how it works at a high level...
[Walk through architecture diagram]

The key innovation is the rule-based severity assessment."
```

### **Pipeline Details (15-20 minutes)** ‚≠ê MOST TIME
```
"Let me walk you through what happens when a user uploads an image...

Step 1: YOLO detects damages [2 min]
Step 2: Rule-based assesses severity [8 min - DETAILED]
Step 3: Fraud detection validates claim [3 min]
Step 4: Cost is calculated [2 min]
Step 5: Report is generated [2 min]"
```

### **Rule-Based Severity (8-10 minutes)** ‚≠ê KEY SECTION
```
"This is our main innovation. Let me show you why rule-based 
is better than CNN...

[Show comparison table]

Now let me walk you through the calculation with a real example...

[Show step-by-step calculation with numbers]

This gives us full transparency. We can explain to customers 
exactly why their claim was assessed as MODERATE."
```

### **Results (3 minutes)**
```
"So what results have we achieved?

Detection: 74% accuracy
Severity: 85-90% accuracy
Speed: 99.9% faster than manual
Cost: 98% cheaper

[Show metrics slides]"
```

### **Conclusion (2 minutes)**
```
"ESPER transforms insurance from a slow, opaque process 
to a fast, transparent system.

Key innovation: Interpretable AI that explains every decision.

Thank you!"
```

## üé¨ Presentation Tips

### Do's ‚úÖ
- **Start with a story** (frustrated customer waiting 5 days)
- **Show real examples** (actual screenshots from UI)
- **Explain calculations** (walk through severity math slowly)
- **Emphasize transparency** (this is your differentiator)
- **Use visuals** (diagrams, not walls of text)

### Don'ts ‚ùå
- **Don't show code** (you said no code - stick to concepts)
- **Don't rush calculations** (this is key - take your time)
- **Don't skip explainability** (this is what makes you unique)
- **Don't use jargon** without explaining
- **Don't go over time** (practice beforehand)

## üéØ Key Messages to Convey

### Message 1: "Explainability is Our Superpower"
```
Unlike black-box AI, we can explain every decision.
This builds trust and enables regulatory compliance.
```

### Message 2: "Rule-Based ‚â† Simple"
```
Our rule-based system is sophisticated:
- 17 damage types with individual weights
- 3-factor calculation (area, count, type)
- Critical damage detection
- Special rules for edge cases

But it's interpretable!
```

### Message 3: "Real Business Impact"
```
Not just a tech demo:
- 99.9% faster processing
- 98% cost reduction
- $20M annual savings potential

This solves real problems.
```

## üìö Backup Slides

**Prepare but don't present unless asked:**

1. Detailed YOLO architecture
2. Training data statistics
3. Fraud detection algorithms
4. Database schema
5. Deployment architecture
6. Security measures
7. API documentation
8. Competitive analysis
9. Team & timeline
10. Budget breakdown

## ‚ùì Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not use a more advanced CNN for severity?**
```
A: Explainability. Insurance requires transparent decisions. 
Rule-based gives us 85-90% accuracy with 100% transparency. 
CNN might give 87% but 0% explainability.
```

**Q: How do you handle edge cases?**
```
A: Special rules:
- Critical damage ‚Üí minimum MODERATE
- 5+ damages ‚Üí minimum MODERATE
- Manual review flag for unusual cases
```

**Q: What if YOLO misses a damage?**
```
A: Users can add notes, assessor can review, 
and we continuously improve YOLO with more training data.
```

**Q: Is 74% accuracy enough?**
```
A: It's better than human consistency (varies by 20%). 
Plus we show confidence scores and enable human override.
```

**Q: How do you prevent system gaming?**
```
A: Multi-modal fraud detection:
- Image forensics (detect manipulation)
- Vehicle consistency (cross-image validation)
- Description matching (text vs image)
- Duplicate detection (historical comparison)
```

**Q: What's the deployment cost?**
```
A: Infrastructure: $5/claim vs $250 manual
Initial setup: ~$500K
ROI: 4000% in year 1 (for 100K claims/year)
```
