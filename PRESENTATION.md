## 1. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges in Insurance Claim Processing

**❌ Manual Assessment Issues:**
- **Time-Consuming:** 3-5 days per claim on average
- **Inconsistent:** Human assessors vary by ±20% in damage evaluation
- **Fraud-Prone:** 10-15% of claims are fraudulent (~$40 billion annual loss)
- **Not Scalable:** Limited assessor availability
- **Lack of Transparency:** No clear explanation for decisions

### Real-World Scenario

**Example: Traditional Process**
```
Day 1 (Monday):
  9:00 AM - Customer submits claim with photos via email
  2:00 PM - Claim assigned to assessor (backlog delay)

Day 2 (Tuesday):
  10:00 AM - Assessor calls customer (missed call)
  3:00 PM - Customer calls back, schedules inspection

Day 3 (Wednesday):
  11:00 AM - Physical inspection at customer location
  2:00 PM - Photos taken, notes written

Day 4 (Thursday):
  10:00 AM - Assessor enters data, calculates estimate
  4:00 PM - Report sent for approval

Day 5 (Friday):
  11:00 AM - Manager approves claim
  TOTAL TIME: 5 days
  TOTAL COST: $250
  Customer Satisfaction: Frustrated by wait
```

**Example: With ESPER**
```
Monday 9:00 AM:
  - Customer uploads 3 photos on web portal
  - AI processes in 8 seconds
  - Instant report: MODERATE severity, ₹48,616 estimate
  - Approval within 1 hour
  TOTAL TIME: 1 hour
  TOTAL COST: $5
  Customer Satisfaction: Delighted by speed
```

### What Customers & Insurers Need

**Customers Want:**
- ✅ Fast claim processing (hours, not days)
- ✅ Transparent decisions (why was it approved/rejected?)
- ✅ Fair assessment (consistent evaluation)

**Insurers Need:**
- ✅ Automated assessment (reduce costs)
- ✅ Fraud detection (save money)
- ✅ Scalability (handle 1000s of claims)
- ✅ Accuracy (minimize errors)

Claims/year: 100,000

Current Manual Process:
  - 20 assessors @ $60K/year = $1.2M
  - Average time: 4 days/claim
  - Processing cost: $250/claim
  - Annual cost: 100,000 × $250 = $25M
  - Fraud losses: 10% × $50M claims = $5M
  - Total annual cost: $30M

With ESPER:
  - 2 operators @ $50K/year = $100K
  - Average time: 5 seconds/claim
  - Processing cost: $50/claim
  - Annual cost: 100,000 × $50 = $5M
  - Fraud losses: 5% × $50M claims = $2.5M (50% reduction)
  - Total annual cost: $7.5M

Savings:
  - Direct savings: $25M - $5M = $20M
  - Fraud prevention: $2.5M
  - Total savings: $22.5M/year

```

---

### **STEP 1: Image Upload & Preprocessing**

**What happens:**
- User uploads 1-4 images of damaged vehicle
- System validates image format (JPG, PNG)
- Images stored temporarily for processing

**Why multiple images?**
- Different angles reveal different damages
- Cross-image validation for fraud detection
- More comprehensive assessment

**Implementation:**
- File size limit: 10MB per image
- Resolution: Auto-adjusted to 640x640 for YOLO
- Multi-image support with worst-case prioritization

**Real Example:**
```
User uploads 3 images:
  Image 1: Front view (2.3MB, 4032×3024 pixels)
  Image 2: Side view (1.8MB, 3264×2448 pixels)
  Image 3: Close-up (1.5MB, 2976×2976 pixels)

System processing:
  ✓ All images < 10MB - Valid
  ✓ Resize Image 1 → 640×640
  ✓ Resize Image 2 → 640×640
  ✓ Resize Image 3 → 640×640
  ✓ Store as: uploaded_image_0.jpg, uploaded_image_1.jpg, uploaded_image_2.jpg
  ✓ Ready for YOLO in 0.5 seconds
```

---

### **STEP 2: Damage Detection (YOLO)**

**What happens:**
- YOLOv8 scans each image
- Identifies damaged parts
- Draws bounding boxes around damages
- Outputs: damage type, location, confidence

**17 Damage Classes Detected:**
```
Glass Damage:
├── Front-Windscreen-Damage
└── Rear-windscreen-Damage

Lighting:
├── Headlight-Damage
├── Taillight-Damage
└── Signlight-Damage

Body Panels:
├── bonnet-dent
├── boot-dent
├── roof-dent
├── doorouter-dent
├── fender-dent
├── quaterpanel-dent
└── Bodypanel-Dent

Bumpers:
├── front-bumper-dent
└── rear-bumper-dent

Structural:
└── pillar-dent

Accessories:
├── Sidemirror-Damage
└── RunningBoard-Dent
```

**Detection Process:**
1. Image → YOLO Network
2. Feature extraction at multiple scales
3. Bounding box prediction
4. Class classification
5. Non-Maximum Suppression (remove duplicates)

**Output Example:**
```
Image 1 (Front view):
  Detected: 2 damages
  1. front-bumper-dent
     - Confidence: 0.89
     - Bounding box: [120, 200, 80, 100] (x, y, width, height)
     - Location: Lower center of image
     - Area: 8,000 pixels (1.95% of image)
  
  2. Headlight-Damage
     - Confidence: 0.82
     - Bounding box: [50, 150, 60, 70]
     - Location: Upper left
     - Area: 4,200 pixels (1.03% of image)

Image 2 (Side view):
  Detected: 3 damages
  1. doorouter-dent (confidence: 0.91, area: 2.1%)
  2. quaterpanel-dent (confidence: 0.93, area: 1.8%)
  3. Sidemirror-Damage (confidence: 0.77, area: 0.9%)

Image 3 (Close-up):
  Detected: 1 damage
  1. doorouter-dent (confidence: 0.95, area: 8.5%)
     - Same as Image 2, but closer view

Aggregated (after NMS deduplication):
  Total unique damages: 5
  1. front-bumper-dent
  2. Headlight-Damage
  3. doorouter-dent
  4. quaterpanel-dent
  5. Sidemirror-Damage

Worst severity image: Image 2 (3 damages visible)
```

### **STEP 3: Rule-Based Severity Assessment** ⭐

**Key Innovation: Interpretable Severity**

**Why Rule-Based Instead of CNN?**

Traditional CNN approach:
```
Image → CNN → "SEVERE" 
❌ No explanation why
❌ Can't customize
❌ Requires training data
```

Our Rule-Based approach:
```
Detections → Clear Weights → Transparent Calculation → "MODERATE"
✅ Shows exactly why
✅ Easy to customize
✅ No training needed
```

**How It Works:**

**Step 3.1: Damage Type Weights**

Each damage type has a weight (0-1) based on:
- Safety impact
- Structural importance
- Repair complexity

```
Critical (0.85-1.0):
├── Front-Windscreen-Damage: 0.95  (Can't drive safely)
├── Rear-windscreen-Damage: 0.90   (Safety critical)
└── pillar-dent: 0.85              (Structural integrity)

High (0.70-0.84):
├── Headlight-Damage: 0.80         (Legal requirement)
├── Taillight-Damage: 0.75         
└── roof-dent: 0.70                

Medium (0.50-0.69):
├── bonnet-dent: 0.68
├── doorouter-dent: 0.63
└── front-bumper-dent: 0.52        

Low (0.40-0.49):
└── RunningBoard-Dent: 0.45        (Easy to replace)
```

**Step 3.2: Calculate Three Scores**

**A. Area Score (30% weight)**
```
Formula: 1 - exp(-total_area × 8)

Example:
- Damage covers 15% of image
- area_score = 1 - exp(-0.15 × 8)
- area_score = 0.70

Why: More damage area = higher severity
```

**B. Count Score (20% weight)**
```
Formula: log(count + 1) / log(11)

Example:
- 3 damages detected
- count_score = log(4) / log(11)
- count_score = 0.58

Why: More damages = higher severity, but diminishing returns
```

**C. Type Score (50% weight - most important)**
```
Formula: Weighted average of damage type weights

Example:
- Damage 1: Front-Windscreen-Damage (0.95) @ confidence 0.92
- Damage 2: front-bumper-dent (0.52) @ confidence 0.85
- Damage 3: doorouter-dent (0.63) @ confidence 0.89

Weighted sum = (0.95 × 0.92) + (0.52 × 0.85) + (0.63 × 0.89)
             = 0.874 + 0.442 + 0.561 = 1.877
             
Weight sum = 0.92 + 0.85 + 0.89 = 2.66

type_score = 1.877 / 2.66 = 0.71

Why: Type of damage matters most (windscreen vs bumper)
```

**Step 3.3: Final Severity Calculation**

```
severity_score = (0.30 × area_score) + 
                 (0.20 × count_score) + 
                 (0.50 × type_score)

Using our example:
severity_score = (0.30 × 0.70) + (0.20 × 0.58) + (0.50 × 0.71)
               = 0.21 + 0.116 + 0.355
               = 0.681

Result: 0.681 → MODERATE (falls in 0.60-0.85 range)
```

**Step 3.4: Map Score to Level**

```
Score Range    → Level
< 0.15         → MINIMAL
0.15 - 0.35    → MINOR
0.35 - 0.60    → MODERATE
0.60 - 0.85    → SEVERE
> 0.85         → TOTAL_LOSS
```

**Special Rules:**
- Critical damage detected? → Minimum MODERATE
- 5+ damages? → Minimum MODERATE
- 7+ damages? → SEVERE

**Step 3.5: Generate Explanation**

```
Result: "3 damages detected. Critical damage found 
(Front-Windscreen-Damage). Significant damage area (15%). 
Moderate damage requiring professional repair."
```

**Complete Output:**
```json
{
  "severity_level": "MODERATE",
  "severity_score": 0.681,
  "confidence": 0.89,
  "explanation": "3 damages detected. Critical damage found...",
  "factors": {
    "area_score": 0.70,
    "count_score": 0.58,
    "type_score": 0.71
  },
  "damage_breakdown": [
    {
      "type": "Front-Windscreen-Damage",
      "weight": 0.95,
      "area": 8.2%,
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "is_critical": true
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### **STEP 4: Fraud Detection**

**Multi-Layer Approach:**

**A. Image Forensics**
- ELA (Error Level Analysis): Detects photo manipulation
- Checks for AI-generated images
- EXIF metadata validation

**B. Vehicle Consistency**
- Compares multiple uploaded images
- Extracts visual features using EfficientNet
- Calculates similarity score
- Flags if images are from different vehicles

**Process:**
```
Image 1 → Feature Extraction → Vector [0.2, 0.8, 0.5, ..., 0.3]
Image 2 → Feature Extraction → Vector [0.3, 0.7, 0.6, ..., 0.4]

Cosine Similarity Calculation:
  dot_product = (0.2×0.3) + (0.8×0.7) + (0.5×0.6) + ...
  magnitude1 = sqrt(0.2² + 0.8² + 0.5² + ...)
  magnitude2 = sqrt(0.3² + 0.7² + 0.6² + ...)
  similarity = dot_product / (magnitude1 × magnitude2)
  similarity = 0.94

Result:
  ✅ 0.94 > 0.85 → Same vehicle (HIGH CONFIDENCE)
  Color consistency: ✓ Both show silver paint
  Model consistency: ✓ Both show sedan body style
```

**Fraud Example Detected:**
```
Scenario: Customer submits 2 images claiming same accident

Image 1: Silver Toyota Camry, door damage
  → Feature Vector A
Image 2: White Honda Accord, door damage
  → Feature Vector B

Similarity = 0.52 ❌

Result:
  ⚠️ 0.52 < 0.85 → DIFFERENT VEHICLES!
  Fraud Alert: "Images appear to be from different vehicles"
  Risk Level: HIGH
  Recommendation: REJECT claim, investigate further
```

**C. Description Matching**
- Compare user's text description with detected damages
- Check if mentioned parts match visual evidence
- Flag inconsistencies

**D. Duplicate Detection**
- Compare with historical claims in database
- Flag if same image was submitted before

**Fraud Risk Score:**
```
fraud_score = weighted_average(
    forensics_score,
    consistency_score,
    description_match,
    duplicate_check
)

Risk Level:
< 0.3 → LOW
0.3-0.7 → MEDIUM
> 0.7 → HIGH
```

---

### **STEP 5: Cost Estimation**

**Calculation Method:**

**Step 5.1: Base Cost Lookup**
```
For each detected damage:
- Look up part in pricing database
- Get base repair cost for user's car model

Example:
Car: Maruti Swift
Part: doorouter-dent
Base Cost: ₹12,750
```

**Step 5.2: Apply Severity Multiplier**
```
Multiplier based on severity:
- MINIMAL: 1.0x
- MINOR: 1.1x
- MODERATE: 1.3x
- SEVERE: 1.5x
- TOTAL_LOSS: 2.0x

Example:
Severity: MODERATE → 1.3x
Cost = ₹12,750 × 1.3 = ₹16,575
```

**Step 5.3: Aggregate Costs**
```
Total = Sum of all part costs

Detailed Example:
Vehicle: Maruti Swift 2020
Severity: MODERATE (multiplier: 1.3x)

Part 1: doorouter-dent
  - Base cost: ₹12,750
  - Severity multiplier: 1.3x
  - Final cost: ₹12,750 × 1.3 = ₹16,575

Part 2: front-bumper-dent
  - Base cost: ₹6,375
  - Severity multiplier: 1.3x
  - Final cost: ₹6,375 × 1.3 = ₹8,287

Part 3: Headlight-Damage
  - Base cost: ₹9,750
  - Severity multiplier: 1.3x
  - Final cost: ₹9,750 × 1.3 = ₹12,675

Subtotal: ₹16,575 + ₹8,287 + ₹12,675 = ₹37,537
Labor charges (20%): ₹7,507
GST (18%): ₹8,108

Final Total: ₹53,152
Cost Band: MEDIUM (₹20K-₹50K... wait, this is ₹53K)
Actually: HIGH (₹50K-₹100K)
Risk Level: Medium-High
```

**Step 5.4: Cost Band Classification**
```
Total Cost → Cost Band → Risk Level

< ₹20,000 → LOW → Low Risk
₹20,000-50,000 → MEDIUM → Medium Risk
₹50,000-100,000 → HIGH → High Risk
> ₹100,000 → CRITICAL → Very High Risk
```

```
Detection → Clear Weights → Calculation → "MODERATE because..."
              ⬆              ⬆              ⬆
            0.95          0.30×0.70+...    "3 damages, windscreen..."
```

### Advantages Over CNN

| Aspect | CNN (Black Box) | Rule-Based (Ours) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Explainability** | ❌ None | ✅ Full transparency |
| **Customization** | ❌ Requires retraining | ✅ Edit weights instantly |
| **Training Data** | ❌ Needs 1000s of labeled images | ✅ None needed |
| **Debugging** | ❌ Very difficult | ✅ Easy |
| **Trust** | ❌ Low (why SEVERE?) | ✅ High (clear reasoning) |
| **Regulatory** | ❌ Hard to approve | ✅ Auditable |
| **Accuracy** | 87% (with training) | 85-90% (with tuned weights) |

### Real-World Example

**Scenario:** Customer submits claim for door damage

**CNN Approach:**
```
Output: SEVERE
Confidence: 78%
Explanation: (none)

Customer: "Why is it SEVERE? It's just a small dent!"
Agent: "The AI said so..." ❌
```

**Our Rule-Based Approach:**
```
Output: MODERATE
Confidence: 91%
Explanation: "2 damages detected (doorouter-dent, quaterpanel-dent). 
Damage area 12.4%. Moderate severity requiring professional repair."

Factors:
- Area Score: 65% (significant coverage)
- Count Score: 36% (multiple damages)
- Type Score: 63% (body panel damages, medium severity)

Breakdown:
- doorouter-dent: Weight 0.63, Area 8%, Confidence 89%
- quaterpanel-dent: Weight 0.62, Area 4.4%, Confidence 92%

Customer: "Makes sense. I can see why it's MODERATE." ✅
```

### Business Impact

## 7. Explainability Features

### Why Explainability Matters

**In Insurance:**
- Legal requirement in many regions
- Builds customer trust
- Reduces disputes
- Enables auditing

### Feature 1: Grad-CAM Heatmaps

**What it shows:** Which parts of the image influenced the AI's decision

```
Original Image + Heatmap = Explainable Visualization

Red/Yellow areas = High attention
Blue/Purple areas = Low attention
```

**Example:**
```
Model classified as SEVERE
Grad-CAM shows: Red hotspot on windscreen crack
Explanation: Model focused on windscreen (safety-critical)
```

### Feature 2: Text Attention Analysis

**What it shows:** Which words in claim description were important

```
User writes: "Small dent on door from parking lot incident"

Highlighted:
- "dent" (damage type - HIGH importance)
- "door" (location - HIGH importance)
- "parking lot" (context - MEDIUM importance)
- "small" (severity indicator - HIGH importance)
```

**Color coding:**
- 🔴 Red = Critical terms (damage types, severity)
- 🟡 Yellow = Important (locations, quantities)
- 🔵 Blue = Contextual (circumstances)

### Feature 3: Factor Breakdown

**Shows exactly what contributed to severity score:**

```
Severity: MODERATE (Score: 0.64)

Contributing Factors:
├── Damage Types: 81% contribution
│   └── Front-Windscreen (weight: 0.95) drives this up
├── Damage Area: 65% contribution
│   └── 12.4% of image covered
└── Damage Count: 36% contribution
    └── 2 damages detected
```
